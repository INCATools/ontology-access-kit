title: Obographs Datamodel
name: obographs_datamodel
description: >-
  A data model for graph-oriented representations of ontologies.
  Each ontology is represented as a Graph, and multiple ontologies
  can be connected together in a GraphDocument.
  
  The principle elements of a Graph are Node objects and Edge objects.
  A Node represents an arbitrary ontology element, including but not limited
  to the core terms in the ontology. Edges represent simple relationships between
  Nodes. Nodes and Edges can both have Meta objects attached, providing
  additional metedata.
  
  Not everything in an ontology can be represented as nodes and edges.
  More complex axioms have specialized structures such as DomainRangeAxiom
  objects and LogicalDefinitionAxiom.
