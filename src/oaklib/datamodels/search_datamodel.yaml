name: search-datamodel
description: |-
  A datamodel for representing a search configuration and results.
  
  This is intended to provide a unified layer over both:
  
  - (a) how searches are *parameterized*
  - (b) the structure of search *results*.
  
  The scope is any kind of service that provides search over *named entities*, including ontology concepts. It is not intended to cover generic
  search results, e.g. google search, although parts could be generalized for this purpose.
