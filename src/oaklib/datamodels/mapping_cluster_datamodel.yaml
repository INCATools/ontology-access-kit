title: Mapping Cluster Datamodel
name: mapping-cluster-datamodel
description: |-
  A datamodel for specifying mapping clusters, such as those retrieved from boomer.
  
  A mapping cluster is the cluster formed from all potential and actual links between
  a set of ontology entities, such as terms/classes.
  
  - Potential links come from heuristic processes such as lexical alignment, and have
    probabilities associated
  - Actual links come from the asserted logical axioms in the ontology, typically subClassOf
  
  A *solution* for the cluster is an interpretation of potential links, aka hypothetical
  axioms.
  
  The probability of a solution is Pr(H|A), i.e. the probability of the set of hypothetical
  axiom interpretations given the set of actual axioms:
  
  ```
             P(A|H) P(H)          
  Pr(H|A) =   -----------
                P(A)
  ```
  
  The term P(H) represents the *prior* probability of the set of hypothetical axioms, multiplying
  all individual prior probabilities.
  
  The term P(A|H) represents the *conditional* probability of the axioms given the hypotheses, i.e
  the likelihood of the hypothetical axioms given actual axioms.
  Tools such as boomer treat this as a constant for all satisfiable solutions. If a solution H,A is
  unsatisfiable, then P(A|H) = 0

            would be a constant factor multiplied by the priors.
            For unsatisfiable solutions, the conditional probability is zero.
