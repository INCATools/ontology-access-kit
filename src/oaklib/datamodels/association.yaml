title: OAK Association Data Model
name: association
description: |-
  A datamodel for representing generic associations.
  
  The core datamodel is broad, encompassing the W3 Open Annotation data model as well
  as common ontology annotation data models using in the biosciences.

classes:

  Association:
    class_uri: oa:Annotation
    description: A generic association between a thing (subject) and another thing (object).
    slots:
      - subject
      - predicate
      - object
      - property_values
      - subject_label
      - predicate_label
      - object_label

  NegatedAssociation:
    description: A negated association between a thing (subject) and another thing (object).
    slots:
      - subject
      - predicate
      - object
      - property_values
      - subject_label
      - predicate_label
      - object_label

  PropertyValue:
    description: A generic tag-value that can be associated with an association.
    slots:
      - predicate
      - object

  RollupGroup:
    slots:
      - group_object
      - sub_groups
      - associations

  ParserConfiguration:
    attributes:
      preserve_negated_associations:
        range: boolean
        description: |-
          If true, then the parser will keep negated associations in the output.
          If false, then the parser will remove negated associations from the output.
      include_association_attributes:
        range: boolean
        description: |-
          If true, then the parser will include non S/P/O properties as additional attributes.
          This may result in slower parsing
      

slots:
  subject:
    description: The thing which the association is about.

      - it is conventional for the subject to be the "entity" and the object to be the ontological descriptor
