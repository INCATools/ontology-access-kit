title: OAK Association Data Model
name: association
description: |-
  A data model for representing generic associations and changes of these associations.
  
  The core data model is broad, encompassing the W3 Open Annotation data model as well
  as common ontology annotation data models using in the biosciences, such as the GAF
  data model used by the Gene Ontology, and the HPOA association model used by the Human Phenotype
  Ontology.
  
  The core elements of the data model are the *subject* (the entity being described) and the *object*
  (the term, descriptor, or other entity that describes some aspect of the subject).
  
  A subject might be a biological entity such as gene, drug, disease, person, or chemical. The object is typically
  a class from an ontology such as a term from GO.

        description: |-
          If true, then the parser will keep negated associations in the output.
          If false, then the parser will remove negated associations from the output.
        comments:
          - Note that to be defensive most applications should leave the default as false
      include_association_attributes:
        range: boolean
        description: |-
          If true, then the parser will include non S/P/O properties as additional attributes.
          This may result in slower parsing
