classes:
  Term:
    description: An ontology term. In this model this is either the SubjectTerm of a taxon constraint, or an actual taxon
    abstract: true
    class_uri: owl:Class
    attributes:
      id:
        range: uriorcurie
        identifier: true
        description: the OBO CURIE for the term
      label:
        slot_uri: rdfs:label
        range: string
        description: the human readable name or label of the term
  SubjectTerm:
    description: >-
      A term that is the subject of a taxon constraint. Typically comes from ontologies like GO, UBERON, CL, ...
    is_a: Term
    attributes:
      description:
        description: A description of the term
      unsatisfiable:
        range: boolean
        description: If true then some combination of taxon constraints plus ontology lead to contradictions
      only_in:
        description: >
          Points to a taxon constraint that states the SubjectTerm is ONLY found in a taxon or descendant.
          Formally, the term AND its descendants MUST be in the specified taxon, or a descendant of that taxon
        comments:
          - Note that we conflate between the RO "only in taxon" and "in taxon" relations here
        range: TaxonConstraint
        multivalued: true
        slot_uri: RO:0002160
      never_in:
        description: >
          Points to a taxon constraint that states the SubjectTerm is NEVER found in a taxon or descendant.
          Formally, the term AND its descendants MUST NOT be in the specified taxon, or a descendant of that taxon
        range: TaxonConstraint
        multivalued: true
        slot_uri: RO:0002161
      present_in:
        range: TaxonConstraint

          The term MAY be in the specified taxon, or a descendant of that taxon

    description: >-
      A term that represents a relationship type

  TaxonConstraint:
    description: >-
      An individual taxon constraint
    class_uri: rdf:Statement
    attributes:
      subject:
        slot_uri: rdf:subject
        range: SubjectTerm
        description: The term to which the constraint applies
        comments:
          - this is a reciprocal slot and will be the same as the containing SubjectTerm
      predicate:
        slot_uri: rdf:predicate
        range: PredicateTerm
        description: The relationship type for the constraint (e.g. in_taxon, never_in taxon)
        todos:
          - define a value set of this
      asserted:
        range: boolean
        description: >-
          holds if the constraint is asserted in the source ontology, rather than inferred by rules or reasoning
      evolutionary:
        range: boolean
        description: >-
          holds if the constraint is an evolutionary statement
      redundant:
        range: boolean
        description: >-
          True if this is redundant within the set of constraints of the same type (never vs only)
      redundant_with_only_in:
        range: boolean
        description: >-
          True for never in constraints that are subsumed by an only in
      taxon:
        slot_uri: rdf:object
        description: >-
          The taxon which this constraint is about. May be species or a more general class.
        range: Taxon
        inlined: true
      redundant_with:
        range: TaxonConstraint
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          If the taxon constraint is redundant, then this is the set of taxon constraints that it is redundant with
      contradicted_by:
        range: TaxonConstraint
        multivalued: true
        description: >-
          If the taxon constraint conflicts with another, 
          then this is the set of taxon constraints that it is redundant with
      via_terms:
        description: >-
          For inferred taxon constraints, this is the term or terms that have the taxon constraint asserted
        range: SubjectTerm
        multivalued: true
        inlined: true
        inlined_as_list: true
      predicates:
        description: >-
          The predicates that connect the subject term to the via_terms.

        description: >-
          true if this is a proposed candidate constraint
