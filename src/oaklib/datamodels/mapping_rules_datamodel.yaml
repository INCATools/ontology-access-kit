title: Mapping Rules Datamodel
name: mapping-rules-datamodel
description: >-
  A datamodel for specifying lexical mapping rules.
  Rules consist of *preconditions* which are used to match elements to match on,
  and *postconditions* which are used to generate new elements. Each rule can be assigned
  a *weight*, these weights are summed and then a logit function applied to obtain
  an SSSOM-compatible confidence score.

    description: A pattern to be matched against an individual SSSOM mapping
    attributes:
      subject_source_one_of:
        multivalued: true
        description: The source of the subject to be matched.
          Multiple values can be provided, it must match at least one.
      object_source_one_of:
        multivalued: true
        description: The source of the object to be matched.
          Multiple values can be provided, it must match at least one.
      mapping_source_one_of:
        multivalued: true
        description: The source of the mapping to be matched.
          Multiple values can be provided, it must match at least one.
      subject_match_field_one_of:
        multivalued: true
        description: The field in the subject to be matched.
          Multiple values can be provided, it must match at least one.
      object_match_field_one_of:
        multivalued: true
        description: The field in the object to be matched.
          Multiple values can be provided, it must match at least one.

        multivalued: true
      predicate_id_one_of:
        multivalued: true
        description: The predicate to be matched. Multiple values can be provided, it must match at least one.

  Postcondition:
    attributes:
      predicate_id:
        description: The predicate that is inferred
        comments:
          - if the rule is invertible, then the predicate is inverted, e.g. skos broad becomes narrow
      weight:
        description: Weighting of the rule. A weight of zero corresponds to 0.5 confidence in the mapping.
          Setting to +1 or -1 indicates moderate confidence or lack of confidence. A logit scale is used.
          All weights are summed together to determine the final confidence.
