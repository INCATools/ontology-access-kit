    The current validation checks involve:

    - cardinality checks
    - mappings to obsoletes

    For cardinality checks, the assumption is that if the mapping is not 1:1, AND either the predicate
    is skos:exactMatch OR oio:hasDbXref, then the mapping is invalid. The oio predicate can be
    omitted from this check by setting xref_is_bijective to False.

    Note that for autolabeling and obsoletion checks, it may be necessary to look up
    CURIEs in a variety of different ontolgies. The default assumption here is that there
    exists a resource ``sqlite:obo:{prefix}`` for each prefix in the CURIEs. This may not always
    hold (the xref may not always be to an ontology in the registry), so if no such adapter is found,
    the autolabeling and obsoletion checks will be skipped for that CURIE.

    The caller has the option of providing more fine-grained control over the adapters used by
    passing an ``adapters`` dict which maps prefixes to ontology adapters.

    The ``adapters`` dict has a special value "*" which will match any prefix -- this can be used in the case
    of application ontologies that merge multiple ontologies together.

    :param mappings: mappings to validate
    :param adapters: a mapping from prefix to ontology adapter. If not provided, will be created
    :param autolabel: if True, will attempt to autolabel the yielded mappings
    :param xref_is_bijective: if True (default), then mappings to oio:hasDbXref are considered bijective
    :param inject_comments: if True (default), then validation comments will be injected into the mapping
