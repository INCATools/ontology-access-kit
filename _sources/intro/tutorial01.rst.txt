Part 1: Getting Started
=======================

.. note::

  At the end of this part of the tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of how to perform different OAK operations on the command line.
  No programming knowledge is necessary for this part, but some basic understanding of the command line and how to install Python is assumed.

First we will install the package and then we will try some command line examples
querying the Drosophila anatomy ontology (`fbbt <http://obofoundry.org/ontology/fbbt>`_).

Installation
-------------

Install from PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^

First, create a directory:

.. code-block::

    cd ~
    mkdir oak-tutorial
    cd oak-tutorial

Then create a virtual environment:

.. code-block::

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH

.. note:: Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher

Then install:

.. code-block::

    pip install oaklib

Run the OAK command
^^^^^^^^^^^

After successful installation, try invoking OAK via ``runoak``:

.. code-block::

    runoak --help

You should see a list of all commands that are supported by OAK.

You can get help on a specific command:

.. code-block::

    runoak search --help

See also the :ref:`cli` section of this documentation

Basics
-------

Query the OBO Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next try using the `info command <https://incatools.github.io/ontology-access-kit/cli.html#runoak-info>`_
to search for a term in the *Drosophila* (fruitfly) anatomy ontology (`fbbt <http://obofoundry.org/ontology/fbbt>`_).

The base command takes an ``--input`` (or just ``-i``) option that specifies the input
implementation. We will return to the `full syntax <https://incatools.github.io/ontology-access-kit/selectors.html>`_ later,
but one pattern that is useful to know is ``prontolib:<ontology-file>``, which uses the :term:`Pronto` library to fetch
and parse an OBO file.

To do a basic lookup, using either a name or ID:

.. code-block::

    runoak --input prontolib:fbbt.obo info 'wing vein'

The first time you run this there will be a lag as the file is downloaded, but after that it will be cached. (This is using the Pronto
library under the hood). The results should be:

.. code-block::

    FBbt:00004751 ! wing vein

You get the same results by specifying the :term:`CURIE`:

.. code-block::

    runoak --input prontolib:fbbt.obo info FBbt:00004751

.. note::

   not all OBO libraries can be accessed via Pronto, and using Pronto for non OBO-Libraries can involve additional steps.
   However, using the pronto adapter is a great way to get started with OAK, as obo files are small in size, and pronto
   can parse them very quickly. Later on we will learn about different :term:`implementation`s

Search
^^^^^^^^

You can use the `search command <https://incatools.github.io/ontology-access-kit/cli.html#runoak-search>`_ to search for terms.
You can also use a special search syntax like this:

.. code-block::

    runoak -i prontolib:fbbt.obo search 't^wing vein'

.. note::

    We switched from ``--input`` to the shorter ``-i`` form. We will continue to use the abbreviation in this tutorial.
    It is up to you which one you use. Some people prefer more verbose explicit options (and the extra typing!). Others
    prefer the more compact form. For the whole command line interface we attempt to follow common standards to avoid
    any surprises.

Here ``t`` means "term" (search in all term fields) and ``^`` means "starts with" (don't worry if this sounds a
bit abstract just now, this will be introduced in more detail later).

This will give results like:

.. code-block::

    FBbt:00004751 ! wing vein
    FBbt:00004754 ! axillary vein
    FBbt:00004759 ! wing vein L1
    FBbt:00004760 ! wing vein L2
    ...

Note that "axillary vein" matches because this term has an :term:`alias`

If you want to instead find any terms that contain the string "wing vein",
then you can use the ``~`` symbol:

.. code-block::

    runoak -i prontolib:fbbt.obo search 't~wing vein'

The results should include the previous results, and include broader matches such as:

.. code-block::

    ...
    FBbt:00046009 ! presumptive wing vein L1
    FBbt:00046030 ! presumptive wing vein L2
    FBbt:00046031 ! presumptive wing vein L3
    ...

You can use the ``/`` symbol to perform a :term:`regular expression` search:

.. code-block::

    runoak -i prontolib:fbbt.obo search 't/^wing vein L\d+$'

    FBbt:00004754 ! axillary vein
    FBbt:00004759 ! wing vein L1
    FBbt:00004760 ! wing vein L2
    FBbt:00004761 ! wing vein L3
    FBbt:00004762 ! wing vein L4
    FBbt:00004763 ! wing vein L5
    FBbt:00004764 ! wing vein L6




Working with local files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To work with a local ontology file, you can provide the filename as input:

.. code-block::

    wget http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/fbbt.obo

This will create a file ``fbbt.obo`` in your directory. This is an :term:`OBO Format` file that
can be passed in directly:

.. code-block::

    runoak --input fbbt.obo search 'wing vein'

This should give the same results as when you used ``prontolib``. Note you can also be
specific about the method in which a file is parsed:

.. code-block::

    runoak --input prontolib:fbbt.obo search 'wing vein'


Introduction to graphs and trees
------------------

Fetching ancestors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next we will try a different command, plugging in an ID (:term:`CURIE`) we got from the previous search.

We will use the :ref:`ancestors` command to find all subclass-of (``rdfs:subClassOf``) and part-of (``BFO:0000050``) ancestors of 'wing vein'.

.. code-block::

    runoak --input prontolib:fbbt.obo ancestors FBbt:00004751 --predicates i,p

You should see body parts such as cuticle, wing, etc, alongside their ID:

.. code-block::

    ...
    FBbt:00004729   wing
    FBbt:00007000   appendage
    ...

Predicate Abbreviations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we are providing the :term:`Predicates<Predicate>` to traverse via the ``-p/--predicates`` argument.
The values ``i`` and ``p`` for the predicates argument are short-hand names for
``rdfs:subClassOf`` and ``BFO:0000050``, respectively.

You can get the same effect with the full predicate CURIEs, ``rdfs:subClassOf`` and ``BFO:0000050``.

.. code-block::

    runoak --input obolibrary:fbbt.obo ancestors FBbt:00004751 --predicates rdfs:subClassOf,BFO:0000050

Possible short-hand names are:
- ``i`` for the ``rdfs:subClassOf`` predicate
- ``p`` for the ``BFO:0000050`` predicate
- ``e`` for the ``owl:equivalentClass`` predicate

Ancestor Statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the previous example we saw that *wing* and *appendage* are ancestor concepts of *wing vein* but we don't
have any indication of distance. The ``--statistics`` option can provide this in a table form:

.. code-block::

    runoak --input prontolib:fbbt.obo ancestors FBbt:00004751 --predicates i,p --statistics

This generates a TSV table that shows all ancestors plus (a) the number of input terms that count this as an ancestor
[only meaningful if multiple inputs provided] (b) minimum distance up from input term to ancestor

.. csv-table:: Ancestor statistics
    :header: id, label, visits, distance

    FBbt:00004751,wing vein,1,0
    FBbt:00007245,cuticular specialization,1,1
    FBbt:00006015,wing blade,1,1
    FBbt:00007010,multi-tissue structure,1,2
    FBbt:00004729,wing,1,2
    FBbt:00007000,appendage,1,3
    FBbt:00004551,adult external thorax,1,3


Oak Trees
^^^^^^^^


The :ref:`tree` command will generate an ascii tree for a term

.. code-block::

    runoak -i prontolib:fbbt.obo tree FBbt:00004751 -p i

.. code-block::


    * [] FBbt:10000000 ! anatomical entity
        * [i] FBbt:00007016 ! material anatomical entity
            * [i] FBbt:00007001 ! anatomical structure
                * [i] FBbt:00007013 ! acellular anatomical structure
                    * [i] FBbt:00007245 ! cuticular specialization
                        * [i] **FBbt:00004751 ! wing vein**

For this example, we show only the is-a tree. You can try other predicates, or even leaving the predicate option unbounded.
This will generate large tree displays, due to the facts there are multiple :term:`paths to root`.


.. warning::

    you may be tempted to pass in only the ``p`` predicate to see *just* the partonomy. However, this will likely generate
    a truncated tree, since many parts of are not :term:`directly asserted`, they must be :term:`inferred` from an is-a parent.
    Later on we will see how to better incorporate reasoning, but for now it is recommended that you always include is-a
    as a predicate

Advanced Search
---------------

Using search terms as parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Search terms can be used as input for *any* OAK command:

.. code-block::

    runoak -i prontolib:fbbt.obo tree "t/^wing vein L.*$" -p i

This will feed the search results into the tree command:

.. code-block::

    * [] FBbt:10000000 ! anatomical entity
        * [i] FBbt:00007016 ! material anatomical entity
            * [i] FBbt:00007001 ! anatomical structure
                * [i] FBbt:00007013 ! acellular anatomical structure
                    * [i] FBbt:00007245 ! cuticular specialization
                        * [i] FBbt:00004751 ! wing vein
                            * [i] FBbt:00047212 ! longitudinal vein
                                * [i] **FBbt:00004754 ! axillary vein**
                                * [i] **FBbt:00004759 ! wing vein L1**
                                * [i] **FBbt:00004760 ! wing vein L2**
                                * [i] **FBbt:00004761 ! wing vein L3**
                                * [i] **FBbt:00004762 ! wing vein L4**
                                * [i] **FBbt:00004763 ! wing vein L5**
                                * [i] **FBbt:00004764 ! wing vein L6**

Note that the direct matches are highlighted with ``**...**``

Chaining Commands
-------------

The output of one command can be passed in as input to another. Just specify ``-`` as one of the :term:`arguments`:

.. code-block::

    runoak -i prontolib:fbbt.obo search "t/^wing vein L.*$" | runoak -i prontolib:fbbt.obo tree -p i -

This will give the same results as the above

Visualization
-------------

Later on we will see how we can  use the :ref:`viz` command to make images like:

.. image:: wing-vein.png


Using other backends
--------------------

So far we have used :term:`Pronto` and :term:`OBO Format` files as input because they are small in size and fast to parse,
and are thus good for illustrative purposes.

In fact, OAK allows a number of other backends (also called :term:`Implementations<Implementation>`). We will give a brief overview of some here


Using Ubergraph
^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`Ubergraph` is an integrated ontology store that contains a merged set of mutually referential OBO ontologies.

.. code-block::

    runoak -i ubergraph: search 'wing vein'

This searches the :ref:`ubergraph` backend using the blazegraph search interface.

Note that in addition to searching over a wider range
of ontologies, this returns a ranked list that might include matches only to "wing" or "vein". Currently each backend implements
search a little differently, but this will be more unified and controllable in the future.

.. warning::

   in future this behavior may change, and relevancy-ranked searching will be more explicitly under
   control of the user.

You can constrain search to a particular ontology in Ubergraph:

.. code-block::

    runoak -i ubergraph:fbbt search 'wing vein'

The ubergraph implementation largely allows for the same operations as the pronto one we have seen previously.
However, not every implementation implements every operation. And some operations may be more efficient on some implementations.
There are a variety of space-time tradeoffs as well. See the :ref:`architecture` document to learn more.

The main obvious difference is that there is no need for any ontology download - so you can do quick queries:

.. code-block::

    runoak -i ubergraph:chebi info CHEBI:15356 -O obo

generates obo:

.. code-block::

    [Term]
    id: CHEBI:15356
    name: cysteine
    def: "A sulfur-containing amino acid that is propanoic acid with an amino group at position 2 and a sulfanyl group at position 3." []
    xref: Beilstein:1721406
    xref: CAS:3374-22-9
    ...

Using Ontobee
^^^^^^^^^^

Another triplestore you can use is ontobee

.. code-block::

    runoak -i ontobee:chebi info CHEBI:15356 -O obo

Currently the ontobee implementation does not handle non-isa hierarchical queries.

Using BioPortal
^^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`BioPortal` is a comprehensive repository of biomedical ontologies.

To query BioPortal, first you will need to go to `BioPortal <https://bioportal.bioontology.org/>`_ and get an :term:`API key` (if you don't already have one).

.. note:: The API Key is assigned to each user upon creating an account on BioPortal.

You will then need to set it:

.. code-block::

    runoak set-apikey --endpoint bioportal YOUR-API-KEY

This stores it in an OS-dependent folder, which is then accessed by OAK for performing API queries. You don't need to do this again,
unless you switch to a different computer.

After you have set the API key

.. code-block::

    runoak -i bioportal: search 'wing vein'

Again the results are relevance ranked, and there are a lot of them, as this includes multiple ontologies, you may want to ctrl-C to kill before the end.

Currently the bioportal implementation is not as fully featured as some of the others, and doesn't take full advantage of all API routes

One of the unique features of bioportal is the comprehensivity of computed lexical mappings. These can be exported in various :term:`SSSOM` formats such
as yaml or TSV:

.. code-block::

    runoak -i bioportal:chebi term-mappings CHEBI:15356 -O sssom

The Bioportal endpoint can also be used to :term:`Annotate` sections of text, for example:

.. code-block::

    runoak -i bioportal:cl annotate "interneuron of forebrain"

Gives results:

.. code-block::

    object_id: CL:0000099
    object_label: interneuron
    object_source: https://data.bioontology.org/ontologies/CL
    match_type: PREF
    subject_start: 1
    subject_end: 11
    subject_label: INTERNEURON

    ---
    object_id: UBERON:0001890
    object_label: forebrain
    object_source: https://data.bioontology.org/ontologies/CL
    match_type: PREF
    subject_start: 16
    subject_end: 24
    subject_label: FOREBRAIN

Note that the results here are in :term:`YAML` syntax, with each result being a YAML document.
The results of the annotate command conform to the annotate :term:`Datamodel`. We will return to
the concept of datamodels later on, for now you can look at the `Text Annotator Datamodel docs <https://incatools.github.io/ontology-access-kit/datamodels/text-annotator/index.html>`_.

Some datamodels can also be expressed as TSVs:

.. code-block::

    runoak -i bioportal:cl annotate "interneuron of forebrain" -O csv

Gives back a TSV table:

.. csv-table:: Annotate results
    :header: predicate_id,object_id,object_label,object_source,confidence,match_string,is_longest_match,matches_whole_text,match_type,info,subject_start,subject_end,subject_label

    CL:0000099,interneuron,https://data.bioontology.org/ontologies/CL,None,None,None,None,PREF,None,1,11,INTERNEURON
    UBERON:0001890,forebrain,https://data.bioontology.org/ontologies/CL,None,None,None,None,PREF,None,16,24,FOREBRAIN

Any other implementation that implements the annotate interface will *conform* to this same datamodel and format.

Using OLS
^^^^^^^^^^

:term:`OLS` is a repository of high quality ontologies. It has less breadth than BioPortal. Currently OAK offers very limited functionality with OLS
but this will be improved in future.

OLS also aggregates curated mappings, these can be exported in the same way:

.. code-block::

    runoak -i ols: term-mappings CHEBI:15356 -O sssom

.. csv-table:: OLS SSSOM
    :header: subject_id,subject_label,predicate_id,object_id,match_type,subject_source,object_source,mapping_provider

    CHEBI:15356,cysteine,skos:closeMatch,PMID:25181601,Unspecified,CHEBI,PMID,CDNO
    CHEBI:15356,cysteine,skos:closeMatch,PMID:25181601,Unspecified,CHEBI,PMID,CHEBI
    CHEBI:15356,cysteine,skos:closeMatch,CAS:3374-22-9,Unspecified,CHEBI,CAS,CHEBI
    CHEBI:15356,cysteine,skos:closeMatch,PMID:17439666,Unspecified,CHEBI,PMID,CHEBI
    CHEBI:15356,cysteine,skos:closeMatch,KEGG:C00736,Unspecified,CHEBI,KEGG,CHEBI
    CHEBI:15356,cysteine,skos:closeMatch,KNApSAcK:C00007323,Unspecified,CHEBI,KNApSAcK,ZP
    CHEBI:15356,cysteine,skos:closeMatch,Wikipedia:Cysteine,Unspecified,CHEBI,Wikipedia,ZP


Using SQLIte
^^^^^^^^^^

The SQLite backend will be covered fully in part 7

But if you want to jump ahead and start using SQLite you can do this with any existing OBO ontology:

.. code-block::

    runoak -i sqlite:obo:iao search t~information

Here we are searching IAO for any term loosely matching "information"

Note there is an initial lag as the sqlite database is downloaded from S3. These can be quite
large as they include pre-cached relation graphs. Once downloaded, responsivity will be fast.

Next steps
----------

You can play around with some of the other commands (see :ref:`cli`), or go right into the next section on programmatic usage!
