Part 2: Basic Python
=====================

Some basic Python knowledge is assumed

Install Poetry
--------------

For this section we are going to use `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ to set up a project. If you are an experienced
developer feel free to adapt these instructions to your favored package manager, otherwise we advise sticking closely to
the instructions.

Create a new project
--------------

.. code-block::

    poetry new --src -n my-oak-demo
    cd my-oak-demo
    poetry add oaklib

Code the first example
----------

We are going to use an example from the :ref:`BasicOntologyInterface`, using a :ref:`ProntoImplementation`

Edit a file using your favorite IDE

``src/my_oak_demo/demo.py``

.. code-block:: python

    TODO

.. note::

    this is still to be filled in. For now consult test_pronto.py in tests/test_implementations
