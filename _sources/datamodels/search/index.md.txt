# search-datamodel

A datamodel for representing a search configuration and results. This is intended to provide a unified layer over both (a) how searches are *parameterized* (b) the structure of search *results*. The scope is any kind of service that provides search over *named entities*, including ontology concepts. It is not intended to cover generic search results, e.g. google search, although parts could be generalized for this purpose.

| [categories](categories.md) | None | 
| [rank](rank.md) | For relevancy-ranked results, this indicates the relevancy, with low numbers being the most relevant | 
| [object_id](object_id.md) | The CURIE of the matched term | 
| [object_label](object_label.md) | The label/name of the matched term | 
| [object_source](object_source.md) | The ontology or other source that contains the matched term | 
| [object_source_version](object_source_version.md) | Version IRI or version string of the source of the object term. | 
| [object_match_field](object_match_field.md) | The field/property in which the match was found | 
| [matches_full_search_term](matches_full_search_term.md) | Does the matched field match the full string | 
| [snippet](snippet.md) | shows how the field was matched | 
| [configuration](configuration.md) | None | 
| [results](results.md) | None |
