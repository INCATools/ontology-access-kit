    name: weight
    description: Weighting of the rule. A weight of zero corresponds to 0.5 confidence
      in the mapping. Setting to +1 or -1 indicates moderate confidence or lack of
      confidence. A logit scale is used. All weights are summed together to determine
      the final confidence.
