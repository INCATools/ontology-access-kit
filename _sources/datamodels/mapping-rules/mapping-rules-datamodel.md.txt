# mapping-rules-datamodel

A datamodel for specifying lexical mapping rules. Rules consist of *preconditions* which are used to match elements to match on, and *postconditions* which are used to generate new elements. Each rule can be assigned a *weight*, these weights are summed and then a logit function applied to obtain an SSSOM-compatible confidence score.
