Datamodels
==========

This library provides different datamodels designed for different
purposes. They are intentionally overlapping in content, and may be
lossy with respect to one another.

.. note:: You don't need to use *any* of these to use the
          BasicOntologyInterface, which uses simple python datatypes.
