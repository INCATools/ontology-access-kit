# association

A data model for representing generic associations and changes of these associations.

The core data model is broad, encompassing the W3 Open Annotation data model as well
as common ontology annotation data models using in the biosciences, such as the GAF
data model used by the Gene Ontology, and the HPOA association model used by the Human Phenotype
Ontology.

The core elements of the data model are the *subject* (the entity being described) and the *object*
(the term, descriptor, or other entity that describes some aspect of the subject).

A subject might be a biological entity such as gene, drug, disease, person, or chemical. The object is typically
a class from an ontology such as a term from GO.
