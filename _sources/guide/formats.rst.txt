Ontology Languages and Formats
==============================

There are a number of different formats and data models for representing ontologies. The
most commonly used is the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which is a logic-based language that
has a number of different serializations and mappings.

However, there are a number of other ways of exchanging and representing ontologies.
This can be confusing for both new and even experienced users.
