def: "The dermal maxilla forms part of the upper jaw. It is first visible as a small dorsoventrally oriented rod of bone in the lateral region of the upper jaw. Through anterior ossification it becomes S-shaped, with its anteriormost tip directed medially (4.8 mm NL). The posteroventral end of the maxilla is connected to the dentary by a ligament. Maxillary teeth are absent in cypriniforms, but are present in other ostariophysans. Two barbels are present on the maxilla. The presence of two pairs of maxillary barbels is considered by Cavender and Coburn (1992) to be the primitive condition for the Cyprinidae." [GOC:ymb, ORCiD:0000-0002-9900-7880]

Possession of a dorsomedial process, which abuts the ethmoid, is a unique feature shared by Cypriniformes (Fink and Fink, 1981). The palatine has two components, the autopalatine (derived from pars autopalatine) and the dermal component having teeth, the dermopalatine Arratia & Schultze 1990. The element in cypriniforms is only the cartilage part, so that it is more correct to name it autopalatine and not as palatine in general that it implies a fusion of elements (as in perciforms)."

comment: Furthermore, zebrafish exocrine progenitors appear to arise from endoderm rostral to the gut tube, which it subsequently joins, rather than as an extension of the epithelium of the main duct. Thus, we argue against a classical model (Field et al., 2003) in which the zebrafish exocrine pancreas buds from either a rod of pre-intestinal endoderm or the gut tube which in zebrafish gives rise to the intestine (Wallace and Pack, 2003).

These same progenitors contribute to adult melanophores (black cell) and at least some xanthophores (orange cell). Additionally, some embryonic/EL melanophores persist into the adult stage (brown cell), and EL xanthophores lose their pigment, entering a cryptic phase (light yellow cell), and then reacquire pigment at a late stage of adult pattern development.

The thinner part runs more laterally and ventrally, and the thicker part was located more medially and dorsally. Both bundles run in the caudal direction toward the cranial wall of the lateral recess of  the diencephalic ventricle, where they apparently exchange some fibers.
