Yolky material is consumed and the fibre tracts and later the commissures develop. In general all of its parts are well developed at NF stage 53 and later development consists mainly of growth and some further cytological differentiation.

These regions of neural crest can be divided into five main functional domains, which include the cranial, trunk, vagal and sacral neural crest, and cardiac neural crest.

def: "Multi-tissue structure that is the filtration unit of the pronephric kidney. A glomus is a glomerulus that spans more than one body segment. It is the vascularized filter of the pronephric kidney. Blood is filtered through the glomus and the filtrate deposited into the coelom early in development, or the nephrocoel later in development. The glomus contains podocytes with well developed foot processes that are anatomically indistinguishable from the podocytes of adult glomeruli. The two glomera are linked via a narrow bridge called the glomeral nexus." [PMID:9268568, XAO:curators]

In males, starting at NF stage 52, PGCs migrate from the genital ridge cortical region into the medullary tissue, where they will form primary spermatogonia at sexual maturity. In females, the medullary tissue remains free of PGCs; they instead embed in the cortical region and multiply to form primary oogonia, which will mature into ova at sexual maturity."

def: "Part of the circulatory system that consists of a series of vessels that collect blood (exclusive of erythrocytes) which seeps through capillary walls and return it to the veins. The lymphatic system of vasculature drains lymph fluid from the tissue spaces of most organs and returns it to the blood vasculature for recirculation. The lymphatic sytem functions in immune responses. Anurans generate a lot of lymphatic fluid, largely as a consequence of their very leaky vasculature and high interstitial compliance. Lymph is ultimately pumped into the venous system by paired, dorsally located lymph hearts. Hedrick et al (2007) showed that lung inflation and deflation assists lymph movement. Lymph is moved during lung deflation to the subvertebral sac from anterior and posterior lymph sacs. During lung inflation, increased lymph sac pressure moves lymph to axillary regions, where lymph hearts can return lymph to the vascular space." [AAO:0010522, PMID:17981861, XAO:curators]

The pronephros functions as primary filtration system for the embryo while the mesonephric kidney develops. The pronephros starts to degenerate at NF stage 53. The mesonephros starts to form at NF stage 39 and contuinues to grow into the adult kidney." [AAO:0000250, XAO:curators]
