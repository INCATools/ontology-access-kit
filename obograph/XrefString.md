# Type: XrefString




_A string that is a cross reference to another entity represented in another ontology, vocabulary, database, or website. The string SHOULD be a CURIE or a URL, but this standard relaxes this to a string to support parsing of legacy ontologies that may use other syntaxes. If a CURIE is provided, this SHOULD be registered in a standard registry such as bioregistry._
