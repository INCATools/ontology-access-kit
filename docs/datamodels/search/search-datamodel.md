# search-datamodel

A datamodel for representing a search configuration and results.

This is intended to provide a unified layer over both:

- (a) how searches are *parameterized*
- (b) the structure of search *results*.

The scope is any kind of service that provides search over *named entities*, including ontology concepts. It is not intended to cover generic
search results, e.g. google search, although parts could be generalized for this purpose.
