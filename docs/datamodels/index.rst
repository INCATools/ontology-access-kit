Datamodels
==========

This library provides different datamodels designed for different
purposes. They are intentionally overlapping in content, and may be
lossy with respect to one another.

.. note:: You don't need to use *any* of these to use the
          BasicOntologyInterface, which uses simple python datatypes.

Each datamodel represents the perspective of one or more :ref:`interfaces`. For example,
the funowl datamodel is used by OwlInterface, and represents the perspective of an ontology
as being a collection of Owl *axioms*. Other interfaces present different views and do
not need this.
