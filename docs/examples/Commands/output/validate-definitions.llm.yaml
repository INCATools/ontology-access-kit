  \ of ubiquinone in Saccharomyces\n  cerevisiae.\nabstract: Ubiquinone (UQ), an important\
  \ component of the electron transfer system,\n  is constituted of a quinone structure\
  \ and a side chain isoprenoid. The side chain\n  length of UQ differs between microorganisms,\
  \ and this difference has been used for\n  taxonomic study. In this study, we have\
  \ addressed the importance of the length of\n  the side chain of UQ for cells, and\
  \ examined the effect of chain length by producing\n  UQs with isoprenoid chain\
  \ lengths between 5 and 10 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n  To make the different\
  \ UQ species, different types of prenyl diphosphate synthases\n  were expressed\
  \ in a S. cerevisiae COQ1 mutant defective for hexaprenyl diphosphate\n  synthesis.\
  \ As a result, we found that the original species of UQ (in this case UQ-6)\n  had\
  \ maximum functionality. However, we found that other species of UQ could replace\n\
  \  UQ-6. Thus a broad spectrum of different UQ species are biologically functional\n\
  \  in yeast cells, although cells seem to display a preference for their own particular\n\
  \  type of UQ.\npublication_type: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\n"
info: 'The term "trans-hexaprenyltranstransferase activity" has a HIGH level of alignment
  with the cited reference PMID:9708911. The abstract supports the definition well,
  as evidenced by these key points:


  1. The study examines the importance of the side chain length of ubiquinone (UQ)
  in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which directly relates to the activity of trans-hexaprenyltranstransferase.


  2. The abstract mentions "hexaprenyl diphosphate synthesis" in S. cerevisiae, which
  is the product of trans-hexaprenyltranstransferase activity.


  3. The study found that the original species of UQ (UQ-6) had maximum functionality
  in yeast cells, suggesting a preference for the hexaprenyl side chain length produced
  by trans-hexaprenyltranstransferase.


  No sections of the abstract misalign with or contradict the term definition. The
  definition is appropriately specific, focusing on the enzyme''s activity without
  providing additional details about its structure or cellular role.'
definition: 'Catalysis of the reaction: (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate + 4 isopentenyl
  diphosphate = 4 diphosphate + all-trans-heptaprenyl diphosphate.'
